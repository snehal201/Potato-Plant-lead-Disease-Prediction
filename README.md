# Potato-Plant-lead-Disease-Prediction

### A Potato Plant Disease Prediction project is a machine learning system that uses image processing and classification techniques to predict and diagnose diseases in potato plants. The project aims to develop a system that can accurately diagnose diseases in potato plants based on images of the plants, and provide recommendations for treatment.

### The project would involve the following steps:

1. Data collection: Images of potato plants infected with various diseases would be collected and labeled with the corresponding disease. This dataset would be used to train the machine learning model.

2. Image preprocessing: The collected images would be preprocessed to prepare them for analysis. This may include resizing the images, converting them to grayscale, or applying other image processing techniques.

3. Feature extraction: The preprocessed images would be analyzed to extract features that are relevant to the diagnosis of the diseases. These features could include the color, shape, and texture of the potato plants.

4. Model training: A machine learning model, such as a convolutional neural network (CNN) or a decision tree, would be trained using the extracted features and labeled data.

5. Model evaluation: The trained model would be evaluated using a validation dataset to assess its accuracy in diagnosing diseases in potato plants.

6. Deployment: The trained model would be deployed in a web or mobile application to enable users to upload images of their potato plants for diagnosis and treatment recommendations.
